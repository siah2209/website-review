# website-review
Demo of a concept website to leave reviews about other websites

This was college project for my interface design class. The goal was to make an interface for a specific purpose and our topic was website opinions via sentiment analysis.

First you can check a url of a website you would like to rewiew. You can simply paste a url in then leave an icon, star value, and a comment. 
All these together generate a sentiment score. You can then hit submit at the bottom and click in the to right to view other reviews and filter via sentiment and other factors

With the webiste html file you should be able to click around and even try out the view other reviews button in the top left
